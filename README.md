Project Euler Solutions - Java 8
================================

Testing out Java 8 features (primarily lambdas and streams) by solving Project Euler problems.

The primary goal of this project is to get familiar with using Lambdas and Streams in Java.
This goals means that the solutions definitely aren't optimal, e.g. brute forced and performing
more calculations than necessary.
